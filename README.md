# Password Generator

If you're tired of thinking of new passwords, try this one out. The parameters are that you can choose to have lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters (~!@#$%&-+=_). You have to choose two out of the four in order to generate a random password.

 Have fun!
